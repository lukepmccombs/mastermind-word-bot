# wordle-bot
A wordle clone bot for use on private discord servers.
Ignore the committed token, it does nothing

## Usage
To start a game, use `%wstart` in any channel the bot has access to.
The bot will encourage play in private DMs, but you can reply in the same channels.

To guess, use `%wguess <word>` until you succeed with the final guess.
The bot will reply with your results, but if you want to show off to your friends, `%wbrag` will print out your path again.

At any time use `%wquit` to preemptively end a game.
